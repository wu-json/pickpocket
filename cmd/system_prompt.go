const systemPrompt = `# Pickpocket — Vendored Clone Manager for LLM Context

This project uses **pickpocket** to manage vendored git clones as LLM context. Repositories are declared in a ` + "`pickpocket.json`" + ` file and installed into a global cache, giving you fast, local access to external codebases.

## Workflow

### 1. List picks to discover IDs

Run ` + "`pick list`" + ` to see all declared picks. The **ID** column (e.g. ` + "`github.com/user/repo@main`" + `) is how you reference a pick in every other command.

- ` + "`pick tag list`" + ` — list all tags in use (run this first to discover available tags)
- ` + "`pick list --tag <tag>`" + ` — filter picks by tag
- ` + "`pick list --json`" + ` — machine-readable output with URL, branch, commit, and tags

### 2. Open a pick for exploration

` + "`pick open <id>`" + ` creates an ephemeral writable worktree in ` + "`/tmp/pickpocket/`" + ` and prints the path to stdout. The ` + "`<id>`" + ` **must** be a value from the ID column of ` + "`pick list`" + `.

Example: ` + "`pick open github.com/user/repo@main`" + `

Use this worktree to freely read, grep, build, and experiment without touching the cached clone. Worktrees auto-prune after 24 hours, or run ` + "`pick open --clean`" + ` to remove them immediately.

**Prefer ` + "`pick open`" + ` over ` + "`pick path`" + `** — paths from ` + "`pick path`" + ` point to the shared cache and should be treated as read-only.

### 3. Get filesystem paths (read-only)

- ` + "`pick path`" + ` — print absolute cache paths for all picks
- ` + "`pick path <id>`" + ` — print the cache path for a specific pick
- ` + "`pick path --tag <tag>`" + ` — print paths filtered by tag

## Add new repos

` + "`pick <url>`" + ` adds a repo to the Pickfile and clones it. Optional flags:
- ` + "`--tag <tag>`" + ` (repeatable) — attach tags for filtering
- ` + "`--branch <branch>`" + ` — track a specific branch

## Other useful commands

- ` + "`pick info <id>`" + ` — detailed info about a specific pick
- ` + "`pick update`" + ` — fetch latest commits for all picks
