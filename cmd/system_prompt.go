const systemPrompt = `# Pickpocket — Vendored Clone Manager for LLM Context

This project uses **pickpocket** to manage vendored git clones as LLM context. Repositories are declared in a ` + "`pickpocket.json`" + ` file and cloned into a local ` + "`.picks/`" + ` directory, giving you fast, local access to external codebases.

## Discover available picks

Run ` + "`pick list --json`" + ` to see all declared picks with their URL, branch, commit, and tags.

## Get filesystem paths

- ` + "`pick path`" + ` — print absolute paths to all vendored repos, one per line
- ` + "`pick path <id>`" + ` — print the absolute path to a specific repo
- ` + "`pick path --tag <tag>`" + ` — print paths filtered by tag

Use these paths to read files and grep through vendored code directly on the filesystem.

## Explore vendored code

**Always use ` + "`pick open <id>`" + ` to create a temporary worktree before exploring vendored code.** This gives you a writable copy in ` + "`/tmp/pickpocket/`" + ` where you can freely read, grep, build, and experiment without touching the cached clone. Worktrees auto-prune after 24 hours, or you can run ` + "`pick open --clean`" + ` to remove them immediately.

Prefer ` + "`pick open`" + ` over reading directly from ` + "`pick path`" + ` paths, which point to the shared cache and should be treated as read-only.

## Add new repos

` + "`" + `pick <url>` + "`" + ` adds a repo to the Pickfile and clones it. Optional flags:
- ` + "`--tag <tag>`" + ` (repeatable) — attach tags for filtering
- ` + "`--branch <branch>`" + ` — track a specific branch

## Other useful commands

- ` + "`pick info <id>`" + ` — detailed info about a specific pick
- ` + "`pick update`" + ` — fetch latest commits for all picks

var promptCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "prompt",
	Short: "Output a system prompt that teaches a coding agent how to use pickpocket",
	Long: `Output a system prompt that teaches a coding agent how to use pickpocket.

The prompt is written to stdout so it can be piped directly into an
agent's context, e.g.:

  pick prompt >> .claude/CLAUDE.md`,
	RunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
		fmt.Fprint(os.Stdout, systemPrompt)
		return nil
	},
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(promptCmd)
}
